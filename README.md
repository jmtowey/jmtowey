- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmtowey
- 👀 I’m interested in economic sociology & computational social science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to effectively use git and how contribute to research on wealth inequality
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but am open to future collaborations on markets, networks, and wealth production
- 📫 I can be reached at jmtowey@fas.harvard.edu
